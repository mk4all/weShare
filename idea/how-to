Currently all info is stored in git.
Marks file is the text file.
I (mk) store music files on smartphone, and make subdirectories and rename them
to store marks. In git all playlists are composed from empty files with track
names. So, after copying files from smartphone subdirectories to git emptyfile
list, you will get correct names and order. All you need is to copy these names
to txt file with marks. This can be done in Windows with cmd command in current
directory, then dir /b command, Ctrl+Ñ, then Paste in any test editor.
