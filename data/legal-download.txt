The problem
-----------

On the territory of USA and Germany it is forbidden to download
music (video, images, books) with violating author copywrite.

Unless you are sure that that author or label allows free download,
do not download any files.

Remark from mklinov: as I understand if you have downloaded file
from official server with permition of author or label, this file
stays yours even if author change his mind. You can delete it on
demand, but no jail or bill. Same as if you downloaded the file
during stay on non-USA and non-Germany territory

Question: what is allowed to do with downloaded or purchased file?
Can you copy it to a new device?
